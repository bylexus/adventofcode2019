My adventofcode.com solutions for 2019

This year I challenge myself by using C++ as solving language - whenever possible :-)


## Compile

I'm using cmake for the build infrastructure. So run:

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build
$ cd build
$ make
```

As always, it's a lot of work, and a lot of fun:

<figure>
<video controls autoplay>
<source src="./src/day-13.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>Day 13 - Solution in action</figcaption>
</figure>
